/*
* PC peripheral chip (zx8302 ic23) registers
        nolist

* The peripheral chip is selected by addresses in the range $18000 to $1bfff.
* The hardware does not decode bits 13-7 and 4-2 of addresses, so the following
* are actually the minimum addresses that perform the given functions.
* On some older ql's, bit 6 is also not decoded, but later m/c's distinguish
* the mc_stat register by decoding it as having bit 6 set.
* It could be unwise to assume that bits 13-7 can be anything but zero.
* It would be novel to redefine the $1800x versions by adding $1c, thus making
* the whole set more conveniently addressable.

* read addresses

pc_clock equ    $18000  real time clock in seconds (long word)

pc_ipcrd equ    $18020  IPC read address
pc_intr equ     $18021  bits 4..0 set as pending level 2 interrupts
pc_trak1 equ    $18022  microdrive read track1
pc_trak2 equ    $18023  microdrive read track2

* write addresses

*pc_clc0 equ    $18000  writing anything here resets the clock
*pc_clc1 equ    $18001  clock selected bytes of time
pc_tctrl equ    $18002  transmit control
pc_ipcwr equ    $18003  IPC write address

pc_mctrl equ    $18020  microdrive/link control register
*pc_intr equ    $18021  7..5 masks and 4..0 to clear interrupt
pc_tdata equ    $18022  transmit register

*mc_stat equ    $18023  on some ql's this controls the video display.
**FIX: chernandezba : This is $18063, not $18023

*************** pc_clock function:
* Reading the longword at pc_clock gets the current time.
* Writing anything to pc_clock resets the clock to zero.
* Bytes written to pc_clock+1 increment selected bytes of the current time as
* follows: a zero in bit 4 will increment the msb (to be read back from
* pc_clock) and subsequently a zero in bits 3, 2 and 1 will increment the bytes
* of lesser significance. Bits 7-5 and 0 are not significant.
* Clock setting, etc, could be speeded up by writing combinations of zero bits,
* but there is strange management of carries which make it far too awkward.
* As soon as the sign bit of a byte is set, the next more significant byte can
* no longer be incremented directly, only by propagation of carry.
* On a crash, there is a chance that there may be rubbish written to memory,
* and, what with the lack of decode as well, the clock often gets messed up.
* It gets reset to one of $0w0x0y0z, where w/x/y/z are small, typically 0.

*************** pc_tctrl transmit control register values
* The values set in bits 4..3 of the transmit control register select the
* device to which data written to pc_tdata applies.
* At boot, zero is written here. A zero was also written to pc_tdata, but this
* has been removed. It had the effect of sending a spurious null to the ser1
* port, which should not have been done.

pc..diro equ    7       direct output (e.g. to network)
*   ?    equ    6       0
*   ?    equ    5       0
pc..serb equ    4       0=serial io
pc..sern equ    3       serial port number
*baud2  equ     2       \
*baud1  equ     1        > three bit baud rate
*baud0  equ     0       /

pc.bmask equ    %00000111       baud rate mask
pc.notmd equ    %11100111       all bits except mode control
pc.mdvmd equ    %00010000       microdrive mode
pc.netmd equ    %00011000       network mode

*************** pc_ipcwr is used to send serial commands and data to IPC.
* The pattern %000011x0 is written here (with x always 1 when serial data is
* supposed to be being fetched), then bit 6 of pc_ipcrd is examined, waiting
* for it to go to zero, indicating that the data bit has been received by the
* IPC and/or that a return bit is ready in bit 7 of pc_ipcrd.
* Nibbles and bytes are sent most significant bit first.
* The sound control function has two 16 bit parameters and, in uncharacteristic
* fashion, these need their least significant byte to be sent first.
* At boot time, %00000001 is written here. at a guess, one of bits 0, 2 or 4 is
* used as a flag "data bit awaiting transmission".
* Note that the PC and the IPC are only connected by two wires, comctl and
* comdata, and the protocol on these is pretty obscure!

*   ?   equ     7       0
*   ?   equ     6       0
*   ?   equ     5       0

*   ?   equ     1       data bit for IPC (comctl/wr
*   ?   equ     0       0

*************** pc_ipcrd and pc_mctrl read.
* This returns miscellaneous data bits appertaining to the IPC link, serial
* output control, microdrives and the network.

*   ?   equ     7       data bit from IPC
*   ?   equ     6       set when bit 7 is OK and IPC is ready to receive
pc..cts2 equ    5       CTS on port 2 (set if ser2 transmit held up)
pc..dtr1 equ    4       DTR on port 1 (set if ser1 transmit held up)
pc..gap  equ    3       gap: set normally, or gap is present on running mdv
pc..rxrd equ    2       microdrive read buffer ready
pc..txfl equ    1       xmit buffer full (mdv or ser)
*   ?    equ    0       network input bit. 1 if active. (netin)

*************** pc_mctrl microdrive control write register
* Selecting a drive is done by clocking a bit along the chain of drives.
* pc..sel is set on the first byte sent and clear on as many more as are
* needed to get to the right drive number.
* Clocking through eight bytes with pc..sel clear selects "mdv9_", or rather,
* as the ql only permits "mdv1_" to "mdv8_", deselects all.
* Anyone who connects more than six external drives will get a shock when the
* seventh one keeps getting selected!
* The clocking is done by pc..sclk transitioning from set to clear, and the
* hardware is expected to be able to manage with one transition each 25us.
* At boot, %0110 was written here, immediately followed by deselecting.
* now just the deselection is done.
*  ?    equ     7

pc..eras equ    3       microdrive erase
pc..writ equ    2       microdrive write
pc..sclk equ    1       microdrive select clock bit
pc..sel equ     0       microdrive select bit

pc.read equ     1<<pc..sclk             read (or idle) microdrive
pc.selec equ    pc.read!1<<pc..sel      select bit set
pc.desel equ    pc.read                 select bit not set
pc.erase equ    pc.read!1<<pc..eras     erase on / write off
pc.write equ    pc.erase!1<<pc..writ    erase and write

*************** pc_intr is read to supply the current set of pending
* interrupts, and is written to clear them and/or enable some of them.
* sv_intr holds the current setting and is managed carefully, on a bit basis.
* The three msbs must be set to enable their corresponding interrupts.
* On read, bit 7 is the baud rate clock, pulsing up and down once per bit.
* Bit 6 is normally set, but is clear while an mdv is running. dunno why...
* Bit 5 is the lsb of 1/65536ths of a second, i.e. straight x2 crystal.
* The five lsbs are set on read to indicate which interrupts are pending and
* writing a set bit will clear such an interrupt once it has been serviced.
* At boot, $1f is written here twice, then $c0 is put in sv_intr to start off
* with transmit and IPC interrupts enabled.
* The second write of $1f, one gathers, is because a bug in the h/w sometmes
* causes the first one to fail.
* The IPC interface interrupt deserves a mention. It was useless, and was
* ignored on Minerva until v1.94. Then Hermes finally got it right, and uses it
* to signal serial input buffer data ready (every 8 bytes).
* It actually also happens whenever data transfer goes on between the CPU and
* the IPC, which could be a problem for people who do not use mt.ipcom, but
* all internal routines clear this interrupt before returning.
