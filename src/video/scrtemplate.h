This is a template for a video driver. It can be used as an example for a graphical video driver,
like xwindows or fbdev. Some other drivers, like curses or cacalib works in a different way

Replace:
VIDEONAME_CAP with the video driver name in capital letters, like "XWINDOWS"
videoname with the video driver name in lowercase letters, like "xwindows"
